description         Module for distributing jobs to a pool of worker \
                    threads.
long_description    Performing tasks in many threads made fun! \
                    \
                    This module facilitates distributing simple \
                    operations into jobs that are sent to worker \
                    threads, maintained by a pool object. \
                    \
                    It consists of these components:\
                    \
                    1. Jobs, which are single units of work that need \
                       to be performed. \
                    2. Workers, who grab jobs from a queue and perform \
                       them. \
                    3. Worker pool, which keeps track of workers and \
                       the job queue.
